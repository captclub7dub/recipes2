            <p>Ramen noodle and broth dish inspired by the Japanese classic using ingredients commonly available in
                American supermarkets. Quite involved, but it has become one of my family's favorites, especially in
                cooler weather. Slurping is recommended.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>water, garlic, ginger, and onion in a large stock pot and bring broth base to a simmer.
                        Reduce heat to maintain an easy simmer for 40 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While broth simmers, fill a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer.
                        Lower
                        eggs into the water 1 at a time. Cook 7 minutes for barely set yolks. Remove eggs from hot
                        water,
                        run under cold water until cool, and peel. Halve eggs lengthwise, place on a plate, and season
                        with
                        salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil in preparation for cooking noodles. Reduce heat
                        to a
                        simmer.</li>
                    <li>Use a slotted spoon or long-handled strainer to remove garlic, ginger, and onion from the broth
                        in
                        the stock pot after it has simmered 40 minutes. Discard vegetables. Add soy sauce, sake, chile
                        sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and salt and stir well. Cover stock pot loosely and simmer 10 to 20
                        minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Return simmering water to a boil. Add noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered,
                        stirring
                        occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain and divide
                        noodles between 4 large bowls.</li>
                    <li>Add shrimp and scallops to the simmering broth. Cook until opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Ladle finished broth into bowls to barely cover noodles. Add equal amounts of shrimp and 1
                        scallop
                        to the center of each bowl. Place a portion of bean sprouts on the side of each bowl. Place 2
                        soft-boiled egg halves, yolks up, resting on noodles in each bowl; keep eggs above the broth.
                        Garnish each bowl with scallions.</li>
